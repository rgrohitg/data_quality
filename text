Slide 2: Introduction to Cube Semantic Layer
Cube Semantic Layer:

Definition: A universal semantic layer that sits between your data sources (like Databricks) and your analytics tools (like ThoughtSpot).
Benefits:
Simplifies data modeling and query creation
Improves query performance through caching and optimization
Provides centralized governance and access control
Enables consistent metrics and definitions across tools

Slide 3: Current Integration: Cube Open Source & Databricks
Current Status:

Integration: Cube Open Source is integrated with Databricks.
Function: Acts as a logical to physical query converter.
Performance: Query conversion takes ~50ms.
